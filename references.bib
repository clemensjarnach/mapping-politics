In this study, we describe the air quality disadvantage of migrants in Germany using objective pollution data linked to nationally representative individual-level survey data. We intersect 1 \texttimes{} 1 km2 grid geo-references from the German General Social Survey (ALLBUS) 2014, 2016, and 2018 with 2 \texttimes{} 2 km2 estimates of annually averaged air pollution by the German Environment Agency for nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and particulate matter. Respondents with a migration background are exposed to higher levels of nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter than people of German descent. Urbanity of residence partly explains these differences, up to 81 per cent for particulate matter and about 30 per cent for other pollutants. A larger proportion of immigrants live in larger cities, which are more prone to high levels of air pollution. This is especially true for second-generation migrants. Income differences, on the other hand, do not explain the migrant disadvantage. In city fixed effects models, the patterns for migration background point unambiguously in the direction of environmental disadvantage for all pollutants except ozone. However, the within-municipality associations are weak.},

Our analysis uses data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study and the English Index of Multiple Deprivation, and employs multilevel models to account for individual-level deprivation, neighbourhood deprivation, and larger-scale regional deprivation. We also examine the interaction between these scales. On average, we find that individual, neighbourhood, and wider area deprivation are associated with a higher likelihood of voting Leave. However, the effect of neighbourhood deprivation is heterogeneous and depends on the broader spatial context: living in deprived neighbourhoods (and to a lesser extent experiencing personal deprivation) has a stronger effect on voting behaviour in more affluent regions. Conversely, the effect of individual and neighbourhood deprivation is close to zero and statistically insignificant in more deprived areas of the country. These results suggest that social comparison processes of in-groups and out-groups operate within larger regional contexts. Our study thus highlights the role of individual and regional deprivation, but also their intersection, in shaping political attitudes and outcomes.},

The partisan composition of local, state, and federal governments, in turn, shapes policy choices and public goods provision. Yet studying representation, government responsiveness, and partisan politics across multiple levels of government---especially at the local level---has been difficult due to inconsistently reported, incomplete, or insufficiently harmonized election data at small geographic scales. This paper introduces GERDA~(               https://www.german-elections.com/               ), a panel dataset of local, state, and federal election results in Germany at the municipality level spanning the past three decades. GERDA includes turnout and vote shares for all major parties and resolves challenges arising from municipal boundary changes and joint mail-in voting districts, yielding a consistent panel of municipalities in their 2021 boundaries. We also provide municipal and county boundary shapefiles to facilitate spatial analyses. Our dataset enables new research on partisan politics, policy responsiveness, and political representation at fine-grained geographic scales and over time.},

More than 90\% of European NH               3               emissions originate from manure and synthetic fertilizer. Understanding emissions from agricultural products at a high-resolution is essential for environmental policy making. Here, we present an Agricultural, Product-specific, AMMOnia emission dataset (AP-AMMO) for 17 crop groups, 2 grass types, and 6 livestock types across Europe at 5-arc minute resolution. We show that European agriculture emitted 3.5Tg NH               3               -N in 2017, with major livestock products (dairy cattle, other cattle, and swine) and major crop and grassland~products (wheat, barley, maize, rapeseed, and permanent grass) contributing 66\% and 14\%, respectively. When aggregated to national and regional scales, AP-AMMO emissions fall within the range of previous estimates of commonly used (yet more aggregated) models (e.g. EDGAR, GAINS, CLRTAP, IMAGE-GNM, MASAGE). Discrepancies occur due to different excretion and emission factors and the spatial distributions of the production and management of agricultural products. This high-resolution database provides a basis for assessing food system transition impacts on the European nitrogen cycle.},

Simultaneously, farm employment would decline by 8-58\%, while unsubsidised farm profits would increase by 8\% under Moderate ASF intake, decrease 3\% under Low ASF, and fall 36\% under Zero ASF. Most profits in animal agriculture depend on public support, indicating widespread economic vulnerability. However, impacts vary across regions: livestock-dominated loss-makers would see losses disappear, while livestock-dominated profit-makers would see profits eroded. These effects could be offset by repurposing CAP savings. To support a plant-rich, just food transition, spatially differentiated CAP reform is essential. We identify five distinct transition archetypes to guide such policy tailoring.},

Previous research has often relied on spatially aggregated data and focused on single-country analyses, limiting our understanding of broader patterns. We address this gap using longitudinal household-level data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study and the German Socio-Economic Panel linked to air pollution estimates (NO2, PM2.5, and SO2). We find that immigrant minorities are exposed to higher levels of air pollution at their place of residence. The overall disadvantage faced by immigrant minorities in England is three times as large as in Germany. Given that immigrant households start under initially higher levels of air pollution, one would expect convergence with non-immigrant populations over time due to residential moves. However, immigrants face a substantial penalty when moving. If native households started in similar neighborhoods as immigrants---the relevant counterfactual---they would experience higher gains from relocation. Socio-economic factors cannot explain these differences. The pattern holds in both England and Germany, although inequalities in residential mobility are more pronounced in England. In particular, racial and ethnic minorities, such as Bangladeshi, Caribbean, and African migrants in England and Turkish migrants in Germany, experience the largest environmental disadvantages.},
