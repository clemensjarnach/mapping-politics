# Methods - Visualising Elections

## Why geospatial analysis?

Political change is spatial. Electoral outcomes are shaped by place — communities, demographics, and identities linked to geography. Mapping makes these shifts legible, bringing together:

-   data science
-   visual communication
-   political analysis
-   reproducibility and open research

This project illustrates how spatial analytics can enrich research in political sociology and public policy.
