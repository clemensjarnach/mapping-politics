    "text": "Introduction\nMany social, economic, and environmental processes are fundamentally spatial. Consequently, many questions in the social sciences require geographic/spatial data. Electoral behaviour, migration flows, or protest mobilisation often display strong spatial, and social-network clustering. What happens in one constituency or local area frequently shapes outcomes in nearby places. As articulated in Tobler (1970)’s famous first law of geography,\nRecognising these spatial and networked relationships is essential when studying societal change or sustainability transitions. Transformations in energy systems, food systems, and climate adaptation do not occur in isolation; they diffuse across regions and communities through social influence, institutional structures, infrastructure, and resource flows. Similar processes underpin other phenomena, from innovation and political mobilisation to disease transmission and environmental shocks. Understanding where and how these patterns emerge allows us to better identify clusters of vulnerability or resilience, diffusion pathways, and points of intervention.\nThis project applies these principles to the case of UK general elections, illustrating how geospatial techniques and visual analytics can illuminate the evolution of political coalitions, territorial cleavages, and long-term shifts in voting behaviour. While the empirical focus here is electoral, the analytical tools are general and relevant to the study of other forms of structural societal change.\nThis course material is designed to lay foundations for spatial analysis and practical application. It demonstrates spatial workflows, visualisation techniques and modelling strategies in R.",

    "text": "1.3 Seat Distribution: The Story in Numbers\nThese bar charts reveal the stark differences between elections. Notice how the Conservative majority in 2015 gave way to a hung parliament in 2017, followed by a landslide in 2019, before a dramatic reversal in 2024.\n\n20102015201720192024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResult: Hung parliament (326 seats needed for majority)\nGovernment: Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition\nConsequence: First coalition government since WWII era\nThe 2010 election produced Britain’s first hung parliament since 1974. With Conservatives on 306 seats and Labour on 258, neither could govern alone. The resulting Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition—Britain’s first peacetime coalition since 1945—implemented aggressive austerity measures that would reshape public services and define a decade of politics.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResult: Conservative majority (with 12-seat margin as 326 seats were needed to win)\nShock: SNP won 56 of 59 Scottish seats; Lib Dems reduced to 8\nConsequence: EU referendum pledge activated\nDavid Cameron’s Conservatives defied polls to win an outright majority—but the real story was Scotland with the SNP’s surge from 6 to 56 seats. The Liberal Democrats, punished for coalition compromises, collapsed from 57 seats to 8. Cameron’s victory came with a promise: an EU referendum.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResult: Hung parliament\nIrony: Both major parties increased their vote share, but neither won a majority\nConsequence: Parliamentary Brexit deadlock for two years\nTheresa May called a snap election seeking a mandate for her Brexit negotiations. Instead, she lost her majority. Both major parties increased their vote share, yet produced a hung parliament. The result: two years of parliamentary paralysis, and several failed Brexit votes.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResult: Conservative majority (80-seat margin)\nBreakthrough: “Red Wall” constituencies switched to Conservative\nConsequence: Brexit delivered January 2020\nBoris Johnson broke the parliamentary deadlock with a blunt and effective message: “Get Brexit Done.” The result was emphatic: an 80-seat Conservative majority driven largely by gains in former Labour heartlands. The so-called Red Wall (long-standing Labour constituencies across the North of England, the Midlands, and Wales) shifted Conservative after generations of loyalty. Brexit was formally completed in January 2020, but the electoral realignment it revealed reshaped Britain’s political geography and would continue to influence voting patterns well beyond that moment.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResult: Labour landslide (174-seat majority)\nHistoric low: Conservatives reduced to 121 seats—their worst result ever\nConsequence: Lib Dems’ best performance since 2010 with 72 seats\nLabour won a massive 174-seat majority, but with just 33.7% of the vote, the lowest share ever for a majority-winning party. The Conservatives suffered their worst defeat in history, reduced to 121 seats. But the headline story was fragmentation: the two main parties’ combined vote share fell to 57.4%, the lowest in modern history. Reform UK, the Greens, and the Liberal Democrats all gained ground. Britain’s two-party system, already cracking, may have broken for good.5",

Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats achieved 12.2% of the national vote but won only 11% of seats. This geographic concentration effect is a defining feature of first-past-the-post: victory depends not on total votes, but on winning individual constituencies. The SNP demonstrates this perfectly, with under 4% of the UK vote in 2015 and 2019, they secured 8-9% of seats by dominating Scotland.",
